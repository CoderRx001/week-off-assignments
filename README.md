# Week Off Assignments


You have many days off to bulk up your coding skills or forget some valuable ones that you worked so hard to remember. Remember that code must be practiced or it quickly goes away at this stage of your learning.

This is a series of tools to structure your study during your week without class. THIS IS TO BE DONE AFTER WEEKEND WORK. You do have a whole week to do both and the more you put into this week the more you will be ahead when we get back to class.

Here are some things you can do to keep moving forward.

1. Assess where you focus needs to be.
2. Choose the appropriate exercise.
3. Breathe, it's all going to be ok.


### Step 1 - Assess where you are

- Do you need to solidify Basic Ruby? 
  - classes
  - methods
  - algorithms
- Do you need to work on Rails conventions?
  - Route, Controller, View
  - render vs redirect_to
  - forms, erb
- Does your Capstone require a great deal of frontend?
  - draging elements on the page
  - timers
  - location of a user
  - javascript libraries
- Do you need to catch up on Contacts, Cookbook or Mini-Capstone?

Before you look at the exercises, make a choice. What do you need to work on most? You could put these into priority of first, second and third. Then look through the listed exercises below. **REMEMBER: You don't have enough time to do it all, so pick something to work on but don't aim for the goal of doing everything. Instead make sure that you are using your time wisely.**

### Step 2 - Exercises

##### 1 - Tic Tac Toe (Ai)*

For: practice on Ruby, Advanced challenge

There is a folder called `tic-tac-toe-ai`, this project is based off a real coding interview question. This style of interview would be given to you in a paragraph discription and you would return your code in 24 hours, 48 hours, or a week depending on how hard it is. These are very challenging the first time you do them. I have started this one for you, and have given basic structure to start you out. You do not need to keep any particular part but the structure is disigned to make it easier in the end. The point of this exercise is to see how far you can get, analyze your process of solving the problem. Do you spend too much time or not enough time on planning? How easy it to read the code that already exists? how dry is your code? Do you need to add classes? Are your methods handling many tasks and would it be easier if they are broken into smaller tasks? 

##### 2 - Complete any missing Daily problems

For: practice on Ruby, focus on algorithm logic

When solving these problems start with about 10 minutes of planning before jumping into code. Break down the big problem into smaller steps (think of the 'how do you make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich' example). Write out the steps in normal person (muggle) english. Refrain from words like 'each', 'iterate', 'loop', 'define', 'variable', 'string', 'integer', 'object', 'method', etc. Once you have listed them on a document or piece of paper in order, start translating them into ruby code.

##### 3 - My Craigslist

For: practice with rails, walking through building an app from start to finish.

Make a new rails app, that replicates the basic functions of Craiglist without location being involved. Your user stories are-

- a user can log in
- a user can post a item to sell, rent, provide service, etc.
- a user can edit only the items that they posted
- a user can view all items available by category
- an item can belong to many categories (example: someone could sell a computer that would belong to selling and electronics)
- a user can select a category
- the landing page should show the last three or six items listed
- an item can have many pictures of what is being offered
- a user can contact the user who posted the item (this could be a simple, comment that is listed on the item's show page that only the 'poster' can see.)
- a user should be able to respond to people interested in their item.
- you can try to get as close to Craigslist's design or you can improve on it with bootstrap.

##### 4 - Basic CRUD app from scratch

For: practicing with rails conventions, simple version

Pick any noun, create an app with the 7 restful routes, 7 controller actions and 4 views for that noun. Keep to very strict restful routing conventions and work on forming good habits, best practices, and orgainization as you code.

##### 5 - Javascript Code School

For: Getting ahead on Frontend and Javascript, Which we will be covering in class a week after you get back. 

Get as far as you can through [Javascript RoadTrip Parts 1, 2, and 3](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/javascript-road-trip-part-1). It does cost money, but not a lot and it's got some fun songs, jokes, etc.

##### 6 - Review and Catch Up

For: getting caught up and review of what we've covered so far.

Apps to Complete
 1. Contacts-App
 2. Cookbook-App
 3. Mini-Capstone
